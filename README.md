# semafero-arduino

Cute model that reproduces the traffic light, respecting the actual timing. (for the meme)

## Requirements

3 LEDs (green, orange, red),
3 x 220 ohm resistors,
esp 8266,
3d printer,
connection cables,
soldering iron

## Instructions

Connect arduino pins 3,4,5 to the leds with resistors, and the cathodes of the gods to a ground on the Arduino.
Enter the credentials of your wifi modem and upload the code to the board.
The program can also run without an internet connection, the timing will be the same, but it will not be synchronised with the site
